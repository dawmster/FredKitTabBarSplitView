# FredKitTabBarSplitView
A subclass of UITabBarController that translates UITabBarItems 1:1 into a Sidebar on iPadOS.

Simply use `FredKitTabBarSplitView` instead of `UITabBarController`.

I created this projects in an afternoon because I was frustrated that there‘s no simpler solution.

There‘s plenty of options to improve this even further, PRs welcome, and gonna add more stuff myself over time.


## Installation
Add Swift Package: `https://github.com/frogg/FredKitTabBarSplitView.git`
